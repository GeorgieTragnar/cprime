# CPrime Project - Archive Notice

This project has been archived as its original purpose has become null.

After extensive development and consideration, I realized that the core language design should actually just be C. Upon this realization, I discovered that [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is already a complete C successor that embodies many of the values and principles that originally inspired this project.

Rather than continue development of CPrime, the better path forward is to embrace Zig as it already solves the problems this project aimed to address.

## Project History

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-layered compiler for the CPrime programming language, including:

- Layer 0: Input processing
- Layer 1: Tokenization 
- Layer 2: Contextualization and semantic analysis
- Comprehensive pattern matching system
- AST generation and validation

The project demonstrated interesting approaches to compiler design and language implementation, but ultimately Zig provides a more mature and complete solution for the same problem space.
