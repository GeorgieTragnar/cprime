# GPU Compilation Architecture

## Core Concept

CPrime V2's three-layer architecture enables GPU-accelerated compilation through context-enriched tokens that are self-contained and processable in parallel.

## Key Design Principles

### 1:1 Token Mapping
- Each `ContextualToken` maintains perfect correspondence to its source `RawToken`
- Enables precise source location tracking and error reporting
- No token transformation or splitting during context enrichment

### Self-Contained Tokens
```cpp
struct ContextualToken {
    RawToken raw_token;           // Original syntactic information
    ParseContextType current_context;    // Where this token appeared
    std::vector<ParseContextType> context_stack;  // Full parsing stack
    std::string context_resolution;      // Semantic interpretation
    ContextAttributes attributes;        // Context-specific metadata
};
```

### Framebuffer-Style Processing
- Multiple compilation passes over the same token array
- Each pass adds more semantic information without changing token count
- Similar to GPU graphics pipeline with multiple shader stages

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Function-Level Parallelization
- Each function's tokens can be processed independently
- Context resolution within function boundaries
- Parallel type checking and optimization

### Class-Level Parallelization  
- Class members processed in parallel
- Independent template instantiation
- Concurrent dependency resolution

### File-Level Parallelization
- Multiple source files compiled simultaneously
- Cross-file dependencies resolved in separate pass
- Module interface compilation

## GPU-Ready Properties

### Fixed Memory Layout
- `ContextualToken` has predictable size and alignment
- Token arrays map directly to GPU memory buffers  
- No dynamic allocation during core compilation passes

### Independent Processing
- Each token contains complete context for decision-making
- No need for global state access during parallel phases
- Enables SIMD/GPU kernel execution

### Batch Operations
- Context resolution applied to token ranges
- Type checking vectorized across similar constructs
- Code generation parallelized by compilation unit

## Example: Runtime Keyword Resolution

```cpp
// Input: "runtime exposes UserOps"
// Context: Inside class block

ContextualToken runtime_token {
    .raw_token = RawToken{KEYWORD, "runtime", 2, 5, 23},
    .current_context = ParseContextType::Block,  
    .context_resolution = "RuntimeAccessRight",
    .attributes = {{"access_type", "runtime"}}
};
```

This token is fully self-contained - GPU kernels can process it without accessing external parsing state.

## Performance Benefits

- **Throughput**: Process thousands of tokens simultaneously
- **Memory Bandwidth**: Optimal GPU memory access patterns  
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with GPU cores
- **Cache Efficiency**: Predictable memory layout reduces cache misses
