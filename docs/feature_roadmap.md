## Implementation Notes

### Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Defer Statement**: Critical for proper resource management, aligns with Go-style patterns documented in concurrency.md
2. **Aggregate Initialization**: Needed to make constructor/destructor tests more comprehensive and practical
3. **Complete Pointer/Reference Operations**: Finish the partially implemented pointer system

### Architecture Decisions
- CPrime follows C++ memory semantics (not Rust borrow checker)
- Three-class system: data classes, functional classes, danger classes
- RAII patterns encouraged through constructor/destructor lifecycle
- Manual memory management with smart pointer abstractions
- Compositional polymorphism instead of inheritance

### Testing Strategy
- Each major feature requires comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests for feature combinations
- Performance benchmarks for memory management features
- Compatibility tests with C++ migration patterns

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Update language reference with defer syntax
- [ ] Add aggregate initialization examples
- [ ] Create memory management best practices guide
- [ ] Document three-class system usage patterns
- [ ] Add concurrency programming guide when implemented
